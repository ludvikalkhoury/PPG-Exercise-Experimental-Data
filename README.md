Each of the 14 datasets encloses the following:  
1- Time interval of the entire experiment (1st column)  
2- 3-axial X, Y, and Z accelerometer readings (2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns, respectively)  
3- Electrocadiagraphy (ECG) waveform (5th column)  
4- Photoplethysmopraghy (PPG) red and infrared waveforms from channel A (6th column for red and 7th column for infrared, respectively)  
5- Photoplethysmopraghy (PPG) red and infrared waveforms from channel B (8th column for red and 9th column for infrared, respectively)  
6- Nonin 8000R Sensor SpO2 readings (10th column)  

Note: The sampling frequency is 256 Hz
